# Labs dependency and General chat refresh — 2026-10-04

Follow-up: [compatible bulk updates and interaction fixes](./dependency-bulk-update-2026-10-04.md) now update the linked siblings and supersede their audit findings below. This report records the initial Labs-only refresh.

Labs now uses vd3 1.7.5 and offers General chat only. Dictation, read-aloud, Conversation Mode, model comparison and standalone documentation search remain available. The public AiChat API and sibling source packages were not changed.

## Dependencies reviewed

Registry metadata and `pnpm outdated --format json` were checked on 2026-10-04. The final outdated result is `{}` for Labs dependencies and devDependencies. Reviewed registry packages are pinned exactly; private sibling packages remain local links.

pnpm was updated within the existing major from 10.28.2 to **10.34.6**. Registry latest is 12.9.1; that separate major migration was not included in this compatible dependency refresh. Stable ONNX Runtime 1.30.0 is not substituted for Transformers' required development build: direct VAD runtime, Transformers runtime and copied WASM must match exactly. Installed versions and byte-identical runtime assets were validated.

## Security findings and changes

Before: Labs audit reported **one high advisory** in `vite-plugin-static-copy → chokidar → braces@3.0.3`. [GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm) describes stack-exhaustion denial of service from deeply nested brace patterns and lists no patched version. This is a Node build-tool dependency path, not browser speech inference.

The plugin was replaced with `utils/static-assets.mjs`, using fixed local file lists and Node filesystem APIs. There is no third-party glob parser in this asset path. Dev asset delivery uses an exact URL/file map; production copies match the served `/litert-wasm/`, `/transformers-wasm/` and `/data/` paths. Matching runtime files, search manifest/vector bytes, local executable delivery and production CSP were checked.

After: Labs audit reports **zero known advisories** across its 218 audited entries. This is an advisory snapshot, not proof of complete security. Install-script blocking, the 24-hour release delay, trust policy, exotic-source blocking, peer checks and existing vulnerability overrides remain configured. Only the explicitly requested `@vanduo-oss/vd3@1.7.5` was added to the existing workspace release-age exception.

Linked siblings have separate lockfiles and build processes, so a clean Labs audit does not cover all tooling used to create their dist files. Read-only audits found:

Those paths originate in sibling development tools; they are not installed by Labs' local links. They still matter to sibling testing/build trust. Their configurations were examined but not edited in this Labs-scoped change. Full advisory IDs, affected paths and patch ranges are recorded in [the audit snapshot](./dependency-refresh-audit.json).

## Code simplification

Removed the General/Docs selector, Docs semantic controls, retrieval and insufficient-evidence branches, citation processing/list UI, separate mode histories, Docs evaluation scopes/cases, and Docs-specific tests. Compare now owns two General histories; its exports use **schema 2** with `turns: [paneA, paneB]`, without `mode`/`modes` or citations. Report renderers and consumers use this shape. Suspend/reload preserves each pane's independent history.

`docs-search.js` now only provides the standalone search runtime/presets. The search corpus and vectors were preserved. Labs reports installed injected chat runtime versions rather than older catalog defaults.

## Validation

- **134 focused checks passed** in Playwright Chromium Desktop and WebKit Desktop: General chat lifecycle, IME/HTML escaping, no chat retrieval requests, speech, Conversation Mode, comparison, model evaluation and search. Final strengthened history/reload/schema checks passed in both browsers (8 comparison checks; remaining paired evaluation checks passed).
- **5 actual-model checks passed** in installed Chrome 154: three Gemma E2B/Whisper/Silero/Kokoro turns, cached offline operation, non-silent Web Audio playback, silence/noise handling, Whisper round-trip, microphone resampling/release and no recording/transcript uploads. Models used the existing local mirrors; this refresh did not repeat cold remote speech-download measurements.
- Conversation silence-to-submit: **2.30–2.36 s**; silence-to-first-audio: **4.66–8.14 s** over three turns. These are observations on this machine, not cross-device guarantees. Worker WASM and GPU allocations are not included in main-thread heap readings.
- Real LFM2.5-230M causal chat completed a guarded answer and committed a two-message history using Transformers 4.3.0.
- Production semantic search: **MiniLM and EmbeddingGemma ready in Chrome**, **MiniLM ready in Playwright WebKit**, with results and no page errors or CSP violations.
- Production build passed. `node utils/validate-refresh-assets.mjs --shipped-only` verified hashes/vector consistency for the existing 92-route pinned corpus, matching runtime files, QA/model exclusion and script CSP. This checks the shipped corpus independently of a newer sibling docs build.
- The full default asset validator initially detected that the preserved search corpus differs from the current local vd3 docs build. Corpus regeneration and current-docs anchor parity remain a separate index refresh; the default validator still enforces those checks. No corpus content was silently regenerated here.
- ESLint: zero errors, 10 existing warnings in draw-stencils/draw-tools. Changed code formatted; OpenSpec strict validation passed.
- Actual-model Safari/Firefox speech certification was not added by this change.
